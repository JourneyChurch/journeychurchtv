		<p>JourneyChurch is a rapidly growing, cutting edge church in Norman, OK. With the vision “to see cities transformed, one life at a time,” JourneyChurch strongly believes it is essential to develop high-capacity leaders and connect them to highly compassionate causes. Therefore, Leadership Journey was created. Leadership Journey is one of the many ministries of JourneyChurch. Pastor Clark’s vision for this ministry is to equip leaders to transform culture through biblical leadership training.</p>
		<p>Internships are available today due to JourneyChurch’s relentless commitment to develop young leaders and help them discover their God-given potential and dreams. An internship at JourneyChurch is a catalyst for your personal leadership growth. When most people think of an internship, they have visions of busy work… fetching coffee, running errands and making copies. But at JourneyChurch, we’re looking for people who can contribute to our team. Expect to work hard – reaching cities is hard. This is a calling and a privilege… and it is an opportunity to be empowered to reach your God-given potential and dreams. Keep in mind; however, we are not interested in rising up a generation of errand-runners. We want to rise up a generation of world changers and influential leaders. As an intern, your personal development is of utmost importance. We want to see you impact lives and see families transformed through the power of the gospel. We want you to have ministry experience, as well as a glimpse into the life of someone in ministry. You will gain valuable experience while working alongside JourneyChurch staff.</p>
