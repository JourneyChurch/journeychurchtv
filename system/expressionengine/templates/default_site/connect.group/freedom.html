		<h3>Freedom Ministry is a process of fulfilling Jesus’ mission as described in Luke 4:18-19 <small>(NIV)</small></h3>
		<br>
		<p><sup>18</sup>The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, <sup>19</sup>to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.</p>

		<p style="padding:60px 0 50px">Freedom Ministry is designed to help you become who you were created to be. In Christ, we have the ability to enjoy a high level of spiritual, emotional, relational, and physical freedom. Obstacles such as fear, lack of understanding, and unforgiveness can lead to uncontrolled emotions, compulsive thoughts, destructive behaviors, or broken relationships. All of these hinder our joy and spiritual health. Freedom Ministry is a Kingdom-focused ministry that teaches and assists us in applying the Word of God and engaging the power of the Holy Spirit to overcome these obstacles so that we can experience the abundant life that Jesus provided for us.</p>
