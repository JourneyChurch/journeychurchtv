						Our third annual Student Journey Spring Retreat is April 13th at 6:00 PM-April 14th at 6:00 PM. It will be 24 hours full of fun, small group discussions, serving together around the community of Norman, and much more! We will host the large group teaching sessions at the church discussing different perspectives of our relationship with God, our relationships with others, and our relationship with ourselves. Small group discussions will follow each session. The students will stay in gender specific host homes (hand-picked by the Student Journey staff and have background checks on file). Cost of $45 includes dinner, breakfast, lunch, a t-shirt, fun activity, and transportation costs.

						<strong>1. Do I drop off and pick up my child at the church? Do I need to walk them in?</strong><br>
						<p>For our retreats and camps, we ask that parents walk their child in and check them in with us. This is because we often have extra forms that are needed to be signed and/or items that we need to hand to you.</p><br><br>

						<strong>2. Will I know in advance the host home my child will be attending and who will be staying with them?</strong><br>

This email will contain the address of the host home that your child will be attending, the host home parents’ contact information,  your child’s small group leader’s contact information, and digital copies of any forms that we need signed. Students are assigned to grade and gender specific host homes.</p><br><br>
